You work for a company that specializes in analyzing data for a variety of clients in the sports industry. Some questions that you frequently encounter include determining if a new player is promising enough to invest money in their development, which teams are the most likely to win certain matches, what events will be the most attractive to advertisers, etc. As part of one of your projects, you have been asked to perform an exploratory data analysis of historical data to detect patterns in the provenance, physical profile, and other characteristics of the athletes who compete in the Olympic games. The conclusions of your analysis will help the rest of the team prepare a report for a new client who helps sports gear manufacturers find advertising opportunities.
